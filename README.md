## BBQ Nation Chatbot API

An AI-powered chatbot for Barbeque Nation, delivering accurate, context-aware responses to customer queries within an 800-token limit.

The code for this is included in this repository.

### Core Features

- **Query Classification:** Categorizes queries (menu, offers, timing, location etc.) using keywords.
- **Information Retrieval:** Fetches structured data from CSV knowledge bases.
- **Token Management:** Ensures responses stay under 800 tokens.
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid inputs and provides fallback responses.
- **Feedback Logging:** Records customer feedback for improvements.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for classification, info retrieval, and feedback.

### Technical Highlights

- **Data Management:** Cleans and validates CSV data.
- **Hallucination Prevention:** Strict validation and clear "not found" messages.

### Workflow

1. Customer submits a query.
2. System classifies and fetches relevant data.
3. Response is trimmed (if needed) and returned.

### Future Enhancements

- GPT integration for complex queries.
- Advanced search/filtering.
- Admin dashboard for data and feedback management.
